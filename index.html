            <span class="fragment">, <br>that has become ...</span>

            But why is it called "Scrum"?

            The term "scrum" comes from the game of rugby<br>
            (short for "scrummage" = "scrimmage").

          <span class="fragment highlight-green">
            A scrum is a method of restarting play in rugby football<br>
            that involves:

          It refers to the way a team works together.

            It`s the perfect metaphor for what SCRUM authors wanted teams to do.

            Scrum as a faster, more reliable, more effective way
            to create software in the tech industry
            was created in the early nineties by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland.

          Why did we need this "radical approach"?
        </section>
        <section>
          It took the creation of Scrum to put the following principles into practice:

          Planning Is Useful. Blindly Following Plans Is Stupid.

          <p>At its root, Scrum is based on a simple idea:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li class="fragment">Whenever you start a project,</li>
            <li class="fragment">why not regularly check in,</li>
            <li class="fragment">see if what you're doing is heading in the right direction,</li>
            <li class="fragment">and if it's actually what people want?</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p>And question:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none">
            <li class="fragment">
              whether there are any ways to improve
              how you're doing what you're doing,
            </li>
            <li class="fragment">any ways of doing it better and faster,</li>
            <li class="fragment">
              and what might be keeping you from doing that.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>That's what's called an “Inspect and Adapt” cycle.</p>
